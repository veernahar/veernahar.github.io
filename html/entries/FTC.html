                                    FIRST Tech Challenge is a high school robotics competition run by the nonprofit

                                    Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). Every year in September, a

                                    is released.
                                    The challenge compromises of tasks that your robot has to do on the 12-foot by
                                    12-foot
                                    playing field. For
                                    example, one year you had to bring yellow stones from the depot to the other side of
                                    the
                                    board where you

                                    short projects) to
                                    program a robot, and it was also my first year designing robots without a kit and
                                    instructions. The
                                    challenge that year was to stack yellow stones on top of a plastic "foundation." The
                                    higher
                                    the stack you

                                    points you get.
                                    Over the course of the challenge, I made 3 major robot designs, and learned how to
                                    program
                                    robots in java.
                                    We ended the season with the best teleop as well as the best rookie robot in our

                                    In my rookie year, I learned how important it was to have a super good autonomous.
                                    The last
                                    summer I had
                                    spent hundreds of hours learning java, and this season I started on our robot early.
                                    While
                                    the challenge
                                    comes out in September, I started working on the robot as soon as school ended, in
                                    June. I
                                    then spent 4-5
                                    hours every day for the next 2 months developing position tracking and path

                                    following a path

                                    and to

                                    The second part in my strategy was to learn how to use Computer Aided Design, or
                                    CAD, to
                                    design the robot
                                    before making it. This would enable me to machine custom parts and not be limited to
                                    COTS
                                    parts. After
                                    finishing the autonomous, I spent a lot of time learning how to use Solidworks CAD,
                                    and then
                                    spent a little
                                    bit of time learning how to render my designs in Fusion 360. Head over to <a
