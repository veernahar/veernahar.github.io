                                    In March 2020, at the start of the Covid-19 Pandemic, school had just been canceled,
                                    with plans to go remote
                                    in a week. My sister my mom and I were sitting on the couch talking, when my sister
                                    complained "when do we
                                    get to go back to school." That's when my mom had the idea to make a device that
                                    would buzz when you came
                                    within 6 feet of another person wearing the same device.
                                </p>

                                <p class="mdl-color-text--white">
                                    After researching for a while, I decided to prototype the idea first, using two
                                    raspberry pi's. The idea was
                                    the both devices would be transmitting and receiving bluetooth signals, and by
                                    comparing the signal strength
                                    of the received signals against a threshold, we would be able to determine roughly
                                    how far away the
                                    other devices were. Based on that, the devices would buzz/not buzz. I ordered the
                                    parts that I would need,
                                    and after a few weeks I had a prototype working. I made a python program to print
                                    out the signal strength of
                                    the other raspberry pi, and the results looked promising, so it was time to move on
                                    to v1.
                                </p>

                                    Raspberry Pi's are very big, and for that reason I chose not to use them in v1.
                                    Instead, I opted for the
                                    Arduino compatible ESP32 dev board, which has a bluetooth chip on it. I soldered on
                                    a vibration motor, and
                                    got the same code from the Raspberry Pi prototype working in C++ on the EPS32's.
                                    After decided on a
                                    threshold that seemed to be somewhat close to 6 feet, and finding that it worked
                                    decently, I decided to
                                    contact my school to see if they had any interest in this project, since the whole
                                    point was to help with
                                    social distancing so that we could get back to school sooner.

                                    I had a meeting with the school head and some other staff, and in my presentation I
                                    proposed a timeline and
                                    BOM that would end with the devices being ready before school started the next year
                                    and an initial proposed
                                    cost of <b style="color:red">15 dollars</b> per device. We ended the meeting, and
                                    they said they would
                                    talk it over and get back to us. Later that day, they emailed us saying they said
                                    they would sponsor the
                                    project by covering prototyping costs and buying <b style="color:red">750

                                    Over the course of the next couple months, I worked on the internals, the code,
